# Description
The React Quiz App is a hands-on project created as a course requirement, following the tutorial from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-quiz-app-using-react/). This project is part of a collection of hands-on demo projects aimed for practical demonstration of React concepts learned throughout the course.

## About This Project

This project is not designed for production use but rather as a learning exercise to:

- Apply React.js concepts and syntax learned in the course.
- Gain practical experience in building React applications.
---

The app will have these basic features:
- When the user clicks a button, the next question should show
- If the user gets the question correct, it should increment their score
- When the user gets to the end of the quiz, their total score should be shown

## Live Demo

I have deployed the React Quiz App using GitHub Pages, and you can access the live demo by clicking the link below:
